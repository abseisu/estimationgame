Estimation is a game for 4 players in which the standard international 52-card pack is used. The game is normally played counter-clockwise. The objective of the game is for players to try to estimate the number of tricks they can get in each round. The game ends after round 18.

Cards and Dealing:
13 cards are dealt to each player, the cards in each suit ranking from low to high: 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - J - Q - K - A.

Bidding:
The bidding is split into 2 types: normal bidding and fast bidding. Normal bidding is used in the first 13 rounds of the game, and fast bidding is used in the last 5 rounds.

Normal Bidding:
Bidding starts with the game creator and moves counter-clockwise. If a player lacks one suit (or more), they have to either choose to re-deal the cards or declare an "Avoid".
Players bid in turn according to the estimated number of tricks they think they can get, or declare a "Dash Call", which means that the estimated number of tricks is zero. Players have to declare their trump suit along with their bid.
The winner of the bidding round is the player who estimates the highest number of tricks. In case of a tie, the trump suit is used to determine the winner. The suits are ranked from high to low: No Trump (NT), Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs. After the winner is determined, players are given a chance to estimate the number of tricks they will get based on the trump suit that was selected. The maximum number of tricks a player can estimate is the number estimated by the winner of the bidding round.

Play:
The winner of the bidding round leads the first trick and players must follow suit. Each trick is won by the highest card and the winner of each trick leads the next.
Players unable to follow it have the option to use "trump" cards, which are considered the highest among other cards. The winner of the trick is the player who uses a trump, unless a higher trump is used.
The round ends when players are out of cards.
If no players win (i.e. no one gets their estimated number of tricks) then no scores are added and players move to the next round in which the score is doubled (called "Sa'aydeh" round).
Scoring
Players who get the EXACT same number of tricks as they estimated are considered winners. Points are calculated based on the following rules:

Main points (X): the number of tricks estimated by the player is added to their score if they won, plus the value of the game. The value of the game increases5 by 2 each time.
